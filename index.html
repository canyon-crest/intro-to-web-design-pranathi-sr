<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
<p><img src="images/Gracie-artwork.webp" id="pic1">I love performing arts, which I feel like falls into the realm of art. So, I love to dance and sing, and my friends say I’m so dramatic to the point that I should take up theater, but I disagree. <span class="highlight">I don’t think I’m that dramatic.</span> Also, I would assume that traditional art also falls into that field, and I would include that in something I like to do as I love to draw. I like <a href="https://portal.cca.edu/learning/shops/dfas/" target="_blank">digital art</a> too, but I’m not as good at it so I wouldn’t say it’s a common hobby. Although, I often do photoshop.</p>

<h3>My Top 5 Books</h3>
<p id="p2"><img src="images/sixofcrows.jpg" id="pic2">At #5, we have <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/124932739-i-hope-this-doesn-t-find-you" target="_blank">I Hope This Doesn't Find You</a>, a book that is perfect for people who eat up the genre of romance every time. #4, a classic fantasy, is Clockwork Angel, which is the perfect cozy travel story. My Top 3 fulfills me every time. At #3, I choose Once Upon a Broken Heart, which makes it obvious that I like fantasy - but this romantasy (meaning I usually do not like when the romance isn’t a subplot and rather the main thing) is another level of delicacy. At #2, there is Six of Crows, which is a book where no one I’ve ever met dislikes, as the heists pulled off in the book are top notch. #1, a controversial opinion in itself, is <span class="highlight">The Cruel Prince</span>, which sits at the top since forever, but I love it nonetheless and it perfectly crafts my taste!</p>

<h3>My Top 5 TV Shows</h3>
<p id="p3"><img src="images/compose.webp" id="pic3">For my 5th favorite TV show, I would have to go with <a href="https://abc.go.com/shows/dancing-with-the-stars" target="_blank">Dancing with the Stars</a>, which is a show that I highly recommend because of its survival-like nature, which is a common concept I prefer in shows. Aligning with that idea, my #4 would most likely be Love Island, but more to make fun of than actually watch. At #3, I have this immense love for the disney show Liv and Maddie, which I constantly rewatch all the time. #2 is also a disney show, as it is my favorite childhood TV show, Lab Rats, and I think everyone should watch it at least once. At #1, surprisingly, we have the only non-survival or non-childhood TV show that I like, yet it’s my favorite. <span class="highlight">How I Met Your Mother</span> sums up the feel-good emotions you experience when trying to find the perfect sitcom, and it does this perfectly itself.</p>
